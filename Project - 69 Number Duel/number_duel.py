"""
Number Duel ‚Äî a "cool" number game with multiple modes, hints, scoring, and highscores.
Place this file in Number-Duel-Game/ and run:
    python Number-Duel-Game/number_duel.py

Features:
- Single-player guess-the-number with difficulty levels.
- Timed mode (optional) and limited attempts mode.
- Hints (higher/lower, "close" ranges, digit matches).
- Score calculation and persistent highscores stored in highscores.json.
- Clean input validation and friendly UI (ASCII headers).
